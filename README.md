#Behaviour & Mood Modelling for Complex Care
#Overview
This project is a full-stack system for logging, analysing, and visualising the behavioural and medical patterns of my aunt, who has complex special needs and highly fluctuating mood states. The aim is to give my family – especially my grandma, her primary caregiver – a simple, reliable tool to capture day-to-day information, then use statistical analysis and machine learning to understand what stabilises her and what triggers difficult days.
Building this system is also part of my own development as a software engineer. I’m treating this as a real applied learning project to build skills across the stack:
Backend fundamentals (APIs, authentication, CRUD operations, data validation)
Frontend/UI design that is actually usable for a caregiver
Database design for structured time-series health data
Data analytics and visualisation
Time-series modelling, statistical inference, and ML workflows
Software architecture, deployment, and version control
Ethical and responsible data handling in a healthcare-like setting
This is both a family tool and a training project to further my understanding of software engineering and machine-learning-driven healthcare systems.
Why This Project Exists
My aunt’s mood patterns are not random; they are driven by a complex interaction of factors, including:
Underlying mental-health conditions and emotional regulation issues
Medication timing, dosage changes, and missed doses
Sleep quality, insomnia, circadian disruption
Physical discomfort: infections, hormonal cycles, pain, fatigue
Social environment: arguments, overstimulation, isolation, support
Sensory factors: noise sensitivity, crowded spaces, changes in routine
These influences overlap in non-linear ways, and it’s nearly impossible for a caregiver to track cause and effect from memory alone. Her behaviour can swing sharply within a day, and without structured data, we can’t see the underlying patterns.
This project reframes her daily life as a multivariate time-series system:
Inputs → sleep, medication, sensory/environmental factors, routine changes, health markers
Outputs → mood levels, behavioural incidents, conflict escalation, calm periods
By logging clean, structured data and analysing it properly, the system aims to uncover relationships such as:
A combination of poor sleep and late medication increasing crisis likelihood
Specific activities reliably leading to calmer evenings
Environmental or interpersonal triggers that precede outbursts by hours
The goal is not clinical judgment, but giving her caregivers evidence-based insight to improve her wellbeing – and simultaneously giving me hands-on practice in the applied intersection of data analytics, machine learning, and healthcare-oriented software engineering.
